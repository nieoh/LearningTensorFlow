# LearningTensorFlow
Different tutorials and projects involving TensorFlow


I'm going to attempt to learn a bit about Tensor Flow and hopefully document my endeavors in hopes to keep my learning better organized. (We shall see how long this lasts...)


## Some resources I found useful: 

The TensorFlow tutorials are surprisingly helpful: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials 

The best of the best. Fun to read and very well written. Discovering colah's blog earlier on in this journey set my expectations for ml blogs too high. However, I still forgive them because they are awesome: http://colah.github.io/

Kaparthy's blog posts: http://karpathy.github.io/

## Some resources I used to recreate/ create the code in this repository: 

Daniel slater's intro post on q-learning with pong: http://www.danielslater.net/2016/03/deep-q-learning-pong-with-tensorflow.html

TensorFlow's deep cnn tutorial: http://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html
