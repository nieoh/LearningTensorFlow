# LearningTensorFlow
Different tutorials and projects involving TensorFlow


I'm going to attempt to learn a bit about Tensor Flow and hopefully document my endeavors in hopes to keep my learning better organized. (We shall see how long this lasts...)


## Some resources I found useful: 

The TensorFlow tutorials are surprisingly helpful: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials 

colah's blog set my standards for machine learning blogs a bit too high. Regardless, the posts are awesome: http://colah.github.io/

Kaparthy's blog posts: http://karpathy.github.io/

## Some resources I used to recreate/ create the code in this repository: 

Daniel slater's intro post on q-learning with pong: http://www.danielslater.net/2016/03/deep-q-learning-pong-with-tensorflow.html
